    <h1>Build Shit that Matters</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m Raffi, I previously worked as an Impact Investor, and realied that technology is the most scalable way to change the lives of millions of people. It seeps into everything, and so I’m teaching myself how to code. I sit at the intersection between technology and emerging markets, understanding how new innovations such as IoT and mobile money have the potential to unlock billions of dollars in capital.Test</p>
